Notes on building reliable schemas, keeping migrations clean, and shipping fast with
Prisma + Neon in a Next.js stack.

What I focus on:
- Model data relationships early (one-to-many, many-to-many) before writing UI.
- Keep migrations small and frequent to reduce deployment risk.
- Use database enums for status fields to avoid string drift.

Example workflow:
1. Define the schema in `schema.prisma`.
2. Run `prisma migrate dev` locally and commit the migration.
3. Use `prisma generate` to keep types in sync.

Neon best practices:
- Use separate branches for staging vs production.
- Turn on connection pooling when traffic scales.
