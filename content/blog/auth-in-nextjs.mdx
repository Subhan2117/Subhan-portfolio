Choosing between NextAuth and Supabase comes down to where you want the auth
state, session control, and user lifecycle to live.

Key comparisons:
- NextAuth is great when you want provider flexibility and you’re already
  running a custom backend.
- Supabase shines when you want a hosted auth system with built-in user tables,
  policies, and real-time hooks.

My default flow:
1. Map out user roles and the data model first.
2. Decide where sessions should be validated (edge vs server).
3. Keep auth state on the server and never trust client-only guards.

If I’m shipping quickly with minimal backend work, I’ll reach for Supabase. If I
need deeper provider control or advanced callbacks, NextAuth is the better fit.
